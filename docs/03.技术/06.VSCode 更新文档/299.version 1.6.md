## [September 2016 (version 1.6)](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_6)

### [Release notes inside VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_6#_release-notes-inside-vs-code)

There is no need to go to our website to review the latest release notes - you can now see these directly within VS Code itself. Use the global Show Release Notes command or the Help > Release Notes menu to access them. Perhaps this is how you are reading these notes right now. :)

### [Switch between running Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_6#_switch-between-running-windows)

We added a new command to let you quickly move between open Windows of VS Code. Simply open the Command Palette (⇧⌘P) and type Switch Window. A dropdown will appear showing all the opened VS Code Windows (instances) and you can quickly move from one to the other without leaving the keyboard, right from within VS Code.

### [Image dimensions & Binary file size](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_6#_image-dimensions-binary-file-size)

When you open a binary file in VS Code, extra meta information is now displayed in the Status Bar. For all binary files, we show the size of the file and for images, we also show the image dimensions.

VS Code also now detects image file changes on disk so you no longer see stale old versions of an image.

### [Search term history](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_6#_search-term-history)

You can now navigate to your previous search terms in the global Search View and in the editor Find widget.

- Alt+Up navigates backward in the history. Corresponding command is `history.showPrevious`.
- Alt+Down navigates forward in the history. Corresponding command is`history.showNext`.

### [Workspace Extension Recommendations](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_6#_workspace-extension-recommendations)

Often you have a set of extensions that makes working with a particular workspace more productive. We now support creating a recommended list of extensions for a workspace. The set of recommendations is defined in a file `extensions.json` which is located in the `.vscode` folder. In this way, the recommendations can easily be shared inside a team.

You can create this file using the Extensions: Configure Workspace Recommended Extensions command.

For example, this is the `extensions.json` file that we use for the [vscode workspace](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/.vscode/extensions.json):

```json
{
  "recommendations": [
    "eg2.tslint",
    "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint",
    "msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome"
  ]
}

```

As you can see from the `recommendations` setting above, we recommend that anybody working on the VS Code codebase use the TSLint and ESLint extensions. In addition, we recommend using the Chrome debugger extension.

VS Code prompts a user to install the recommended extensions when a workspace is opened for the first time. The user can also review the list with the Extensions: Show Workspace Recommended Extensions command.
