### [Settings editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_27#_settings-editor)

Over the past few months, we've been developing a GUI for editing settings. In 1.27, we are making it the default settings editor.

![Settings UI](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_27/settings-editor.png)

You can still access the JSON settings editor, either by using the command Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON) or by changing your default settings editor with the `"workbench.settings.editor"` setting.

One improvement we made this month is to clean up the UI by moving setting value descriptions (`enumDescriptions`) into a custom dropdown control:

![dropdown](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_27/dropdown.png)

Settings that have been modified are now indicated with a blue line, like modified lines in the editor. The gear icon opens a context menu with an option to reset the setting to its default value.

Setting values are now validated, and any validation errors are displayed.

The table of contents now will remain visible during search, and filter to show only categories that have matches. You can click on a category to filter the results to just settings under that category. Set `"workbench.settings.settingsSearchTocBehavior"` to `"hidden"` if you prefer to hide the table of contents during search.

When you search in settings, our Bing-powered search service is still providing results that it thinks are relevant. Now, that service will also show you extensions from the Marketplace that have relevant settings. You will see a button at the bottom of the settings search results, Show matching extensions. When clicked, the Extensions view will open with the matching extensions.

### [Platform specific keybindings](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_27#_platform-specific-keybindings)

It's now possible to enable keyboard shortcuts for specific operating systems using `isLinux`, `isMac` and `isWindows` within a keybinding's `when` clause:

```json
[
  {
    "key": "ctrl+o",
    "command": "workbench.action.files.openFolder",
    "when": "!isMac"
  },
  {
    "key": "cmd+o",
    "command": "workbench.action.files.openFolder",
    "when": "isMac"
  }
]
```

This makes it much easier to share your `keybindings.json` file across different machines.
