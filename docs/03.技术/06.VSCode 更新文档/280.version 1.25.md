### [Grid editor layout](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_25#_grid-editor-layout)

You can now arrange editors both vertically and horizontally and have more than 3 editors side by side:

![Grid Editor Layout](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_25/grid-layout.gif)

To support flexible layouts, you can create empty editor groups. By default, closing the last editor of an editor group will also close the group itself, but you can change this behavior with the new setting `workbench.editor.closeEmptyGroups: false`.

![Grid Empty](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_25/grid-empty.png)

There are a predefined set of editor layouts in the new View > Editor Layout menu:

![Grid Editor Layout Menu](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_25/grid-layout-menu.png)

Editors that open to the side (for example by clicking the editor toolbar Split Editor action) will by default open to the right hand side of the active editor. If you prefer to open editors below the active one, configure the new setting `workbench.editor.openSideBySideDirection: down`.

There are many [new commands](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_25#_new-commands) for adjusting the editor layout with the keyboard alone, but if you prefer to use the mouse, drag and drop is a fast way to split the editor in any direction:

![Grid Editor Drag and Drop](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_25/grid-dnd.gif)

Since editor groups are now unlimited and can be arranged in many ways, the OPEN EDITORS view no longer labels editor groups as Left, Center, or Right. Instead, editor groups are now labeled with numbers according to their creation time. The last editor group created will always be at the end of the OPEN EDITORS list. We found this to be a good model that minimizes changing the list when moving editor groups around in the layout:

![Grid Open Editors View](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_25/grid-open-editors.png)

Refer to the [Extension Authoring](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_25#_extension-authoring) section for the impact on extensions and themes and see [New Commands](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_25#_new-commands) for the list of new grid editor layout commands.

> Pro Tip: If you press and hold the `Alt` key while hovering over the toolbar action to split an editor, it will offer to split to the other orientation. This is a fast way to split either to the right or to the bottom.

![Grid Alt Click](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_25/grid-alt.gif)

Due to the grid layout work we have changed how the centered editor layout behaves:

- It is now possible to open any editor layout inside the centered editor layout. Thus it gives more flexibility to the user.
- Centered editor layout no longer automatically enables and disables based on the layout. As this was sometimes confusing and lead to unexpected behavior.

### [Sub-word support](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_25#_subword-support)

We have new commands for sub-word navigation and sub-word deletion. These commands will stop at camel case positions and at underscores (`_`).

![editor sub-word navigation](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_25/editor-sub-word-navigation.gif)

Here is an example for how you can bind them:

```json
[
  { "key": "ctrl+alt+right", "command": "cursorWordPartRight", "when": "textInputFocus" },
  {
    "key": "ctrl+shift+alt+right",
    "command": "cursorWordPartRightSelect",
    "when": "textInputFocus"
  },
  { "key": "ctrl+alt+left", "command": "cursorWordPartStartLeft", "when": "textInputFocus" },
  {
    "key": "ctrl+shift+alt+left",
    "command": "cursorWordPartStartLeftSelect",
    "when": "textInputFocus"
  },
  {
    "key": "ctrl+alt+backspace",
    "command": "deleteWordPartLeft",
    "when": "textInputFocus && !editorReadonly"
  },
  {
    "key": "ctrl+shift+alt+backspace",
    "command": "deleteWordPartRight",
    "when": "textInputFocus && !editorReadonly"
  }
]
```

### [Snippet placeholder transformations](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_25#_snippet-placeholder-transformations)

Snippets finally support placeholder transformations. Placeholder transformations are like variable transformations but more dynamic. A transformation is applied when switching from one placeholder to the next and this is the grammar rule for them: ${_int_/_regex_/_format_string_/_opts_}.

Below is a sample that replaces "Hello World" with its German counterpart:

```
"HelloWorld": {
  "prefix": "say_hello",
  "body": "${1} ${2} -> ${1/Hello/Hallo/} ${2/World/Welt/}"
}

```

Refer to the [snippet grammar](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_grammar) for more details and how to unleash the full potential of transformations.

### [Dismiss extension recommendations](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_25#_dismiss-extension-recommendations)

We recommend extensions to you based on the files you have opened and your workspace environment. We understand that not every recommendation might be appropriate for your project and so you can now dismiss specific recommendations.

To dismiss a recommendation, click on the extension item to open the Details pane and then press the Ignore Recommendation button. Ignored recommendations will no longer be recommended to you.
