### [Syntax aware folding](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_22#_syntax-aware-folding)

Folding ranges in HTML, JSON, Markdown, CSS, LESS and SCSS are now, by default, computed based on the language's syntax and no longer rely on well-formed indentation.

![Syntax folding](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_22/syntax-fold.gif)

Support for TypeScript and JavaScript is also available, and can be enabled by the setting `"typescript.experimental.syntaxFolding": true`.

If you prefer to switch back to indentation based folding for one (or all) of the languages above, use:

```
  "[html]": {
    "editor.foldingStrategy": "indentation"
  },

```

> Tip: See how this feature is used for [collapsing header regions in Markdown files](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_22#_fold-markdown-by-heading-level).

A new API for extensions is [proposed](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_22#_folding-provider-api) so that also other languages can provide their syntax aware folding providers.

### [Error and reference navigation across files](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_22#_error-and-reference-navigation-across-files)

With this release, navigating errors and warnings via F8 (Go to Next Problem) takes all reported errors into account. Instead of looping inside just one file, it will take you to the next file with errors and back.

![Visit All Diagnostics](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_22/f8-navigation.gif)

Similarly, there is a new command to navigate to reference search results. Trigger Find All References on a symbol and now use F4 and Shift+F4 to visit each reference. This is great to make edits in all places that reference a symbol because your fingers don't need to leave the keyboard.

![Visit All References](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_22/references-f4.gif)

### [Hints in the editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_22#_hints-in-the-editor)

The extension API now supports creating 'Hint' diagnostics. They aren't errors or warnings but suggestions how something could be made better, for example, by running a certain refactoring.

We render hint diagnostics with an ellipsis `...` under the start of the word in question.

![Hint Diagnostics](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_22/sev-hint.png)

It is a good practice for extension authors to always include a hint with a Code Action as hint diagnostics can help advertise the Code Actions. However, some users might not want to display hints in the editor so also include support for disabling them.

> Tip: In this release, we have added several hints for JavaScript/TypeScript [refactorings](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_22#_suggestion-code-actions-for-javascript-and-typescript).

Wrap with Abbreviation preview

When using either the Emmet: Wrap with Abbreviation or Emmet: Wrap Individual Lines with Abbreviation commands, you can now see a preview of what the wrapped text will look like.

![Wrap text with abbreviation preview](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_22/wrap.gif)

Faster abbreviation expansion

Expanding Emmet abbreviations in large CSS/SCSS/Less files is much faster now. This is achieved by parsing only a small region around the cursor instead of the complete file when trying to determine whether the current location is valid for expanding Emmet abbreviations.

Smarter snippet matching

Emmet abbreviations in stylesheets are fuzzy matched with [pre-defined snippets](https://github.com/emmetio/snippets/blob/v0.2.9/css.json) to give you the closest matched result. You can control the fuzzy matching accuracy by changing the `css.fuzzySearchMinScore` setting in `emmet.preferences`. `css.fuzzySearchMinScore` sets the minimum score a snippet needs to be considered a match. Increasing the score will result in fewer but more accurate matches. The default value is 0.3 and you can provide any value between 0 and 1.

```
"emmet.preferences": {
    "css.fuzzySearchMinScore": 0.3
}
```

### [Search include/exclude patterns](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_22#_search-includeexclude-patterns)

The boxes for include and exclude patterns in the Search view have been combined into a single box. The functionality is exactly the same, except that an exclude pattern must be prefixed with `!`. For example, `!*.js` will skip searching files that have a .js extension.

![Combined search patterns inputs](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_22/search-patterns.png)

### [Fold Markdown by heading level](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_22#_fold-markdown-by-heading-level)

You can now fold Markdown documents by heading:

![Markdown folding](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_22/markdown-folding.gif)

Folding a header collapses all content and subheadings under that header.

### [Suggestion Code Actions for JavaScript and TypeScript](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_22#_suggestion-code-actions-for-javascript-and-typescript)

We've also improved discoverability of JavaScript and TypeScript suggestion Code Actions. These are proposed changes that can help you quickly improve or clean up your source code. They are shown using the lightbulb widget but unlike Quick Fixes, they do not address a specific error or warning in your source code. Example suggestion Code Actions include: convert ES5 class to ES6 class and convert commonjs module to ES6 module.

Suggestion Code Action are now indicated by a `...` in the editor:

![Triple dots in the editor indicate a suggested Code Action](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_22/ts-suggestion-indicator.png)

Move the cursor over the `...` and click on the lightbulb or press Ctrl+. to display available Code Actions:

![Hovering over a suggestion indicator](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_22/ts-suggestion-hover.png)

![Clicking on the lightbulb](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_22/ts-suggestion-click.png)

![After applying the Code Action](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_22/ts-suggestion-change.png)

We plan to continue adding additional suggestions. Let us know if you have any that you would like to see.

Suggestion Code Actions are enabled by default in JavaScript and TypeScript. You can disable them by setting: `"typescript.suggestionActions.enabled": false` or `"javascript.suggestionActions.enabled": false`

### [Organize imports for JavaScript and TypeScript](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_22#_organize-imports-for-javascript-and-typescript)

The new Organize Imports command (unassigned) removes unused imports and sorts the remaining imports:

![Organize Imports](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_22/ts-organize-imports.gif)

The command works in ES6 modules for both JavaScript and TypeScript.
