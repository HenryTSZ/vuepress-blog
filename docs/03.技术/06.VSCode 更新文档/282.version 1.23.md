### [Run Code Actions on save](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_23#_run-code-actions-on-save)

The new `editor.codeActionsOnSave` setting lets you configure a set of Code Actions that are run when a file is saved. For example, for JavaScript, TypeScript, and other extensions that contribute an organize imports Code Action, you can enable organize imports on save by [setting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings):

```json
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
  "source.organizeImports": true
}
```

You can also enable or disable which Code Actions are run on save per language using a [language specific setting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_language-specific-editor-settings). The following settings enable organize imports on save for TypeScript files only:

```json
"[typescript]": {
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.organizeImports": true,
  }
},
"[typescriptreact]": {
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.organizeImports": true
  }
}
```

### [Problems view filtering](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_23#_problems-view-filtering)

You can now include or exclude files in the Problems view using filters.

- Use glob patterns in the filter input box to include/exclude files. An exclude pattern must be prefixed with `!`. For example, `!*.js` will remove all files that have a .js extension.
- There is a Filter using Files Exclude Setting button to remove all files matching your `files.exclude` setting.

The short video below shows filtering the project `out` directory based on the `files.exclude` setting and ignoring all `node_modules` by typing `!**/node_modules/**` in the filter input box:

### [Copy results from search context menu](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_23#_copy-results-from-search-context-menu)

The search results tree context menu includes three new options: Copy, Copy Path, and Copy All. This was a highly 👍'd request which will make it easier to share or export your search results.
