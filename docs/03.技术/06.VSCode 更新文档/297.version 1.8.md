### [View Picker](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_8#_view-picker)

A new picker is added that shows Views, Panels, Output channels and Terminals and allows for easy opening of those. You can open it via the Open View command or by typing `view` followed by a `space` into Quick Open.

On Windows and Mac, you can press Ctrl+Q to bring up the picker. On Linux, you can reassign the key binding if you want (Ctrl+Q is assigned to quitting on Linux). Pressing Ctrl+Q and holding the Ctrl key while pressing the Q allows you to jump to an entry from the list and open it after you release the keys.

### [Settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_8#_settings)

VS Code's customization model is very simple in the form of a `settings.json` file which you edit to configure VS Code's behavior. To discover available settings, we show Default Settings in a separate editor as well as provide IntelliSense in your opened global or workspace settings. From user feedback and usability studies, we learned that people were still having trouble working with their settings. In this release, we did some explorations to improve discoverability and the user experience for modifying settings and this resulted in the following improvements.

### [Search settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_8#_search-settings)

One of the big reasons for showing the default settings is to let users search and discover settings. To facilitate this, the Default Settings editor now comes with a big Search bar where you can easily search for settings. In addition to showing and highlighting settings matching your search criteria, this will also filter out those settings which are not matching. This makes finding settings quick and easy.

### [Settings groups](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_8#_settings-groups)

We enhanced visual representation of Default Settings groups to make settings navigation more user friendly. We also introduced a new group of most commonly used settings.

### [Quick Edit](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_8#_quick-edit)

We introduced actions inside the Default Settings and `settings.json` editors which will help you quickly copy or update a setting.

### [One Side by Side Settings editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_8#_one-side-by-side-settings-editor)

Last but not least, we grouped the Default Settings and `settings.json` editors into one side by side editor. This addresses the issue of managing two editors for settings.

Explorations and improvements continue... Stay tuned to our next release plan.

### [Keyboard shortcuts](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_8#_keyboard-shortcuts)

### [Key binding command arguments](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_8#_key-binding-command-arguments)

We added support to invoke commands with arguments to the `keybindings.json` configuration file. This is useful if you often perform the same operation on a specific file or folder. Simply add a custom keyboard shortcut to do exactly what you want.

The following is an example overriding the Enter key to print some text:

```json
{
  "key": "enter",
  "command": "type",
  "args": { "text": "Hello World" },
  "when": "editorTextFocus"
}
```

The type command will receive `{ "text": "Hello World"}` as first argument and add "Hello World" to the file instead of producing the default command.

### [Snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_8#_snippets)

### [Snippet Variables](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_8#_snippet-variables)

In your custom snippets, you can now use variables. The syntax for variables is `$name` for simple variables and `${name:default}` for variables with a default value. Variables evaluate to their value, the empty string, or, if present, their default value. When a variable is unknown, we insert it as a placeholder.

The following variables can be used:

- `TM_SELECTED_TEXT` - The currently selected text or the empty string.
- `TM_CURRENT_LINE` - The contents of the current line.
- `TM_CURRENT_WORD` - The contents of the word under cursor or the empty string.
- `TM_LINE_INDEX` - The zero-index based line number.
- `TM_LINE_NUMBER` - The one-index based line number.
- `TM_FILENAME` - The filename of the current document.
- `TM_DIRECTORY` - The directory of the current document.
- `TM_FILEPATH` - The full file path of the current document.

The following is an example of a snippet that surrounds the selected text with single quotes or, when no text is selected, inserts a `type_here`-placeholder.

```json
"in quotes": {
	"prefix": "inq",
	"body": "'${TM_SELECTED_TEXT:${1:type_here}}'"
}
```

### [Snippets in JSON schemas](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_8#_snippets-in-json-schemas)

The JSON language service uses JSON schemas to validate JSON documents as well as to provide completions. As a VS code specific extension to JSON schemas, you can now also specify snippets proposals in the schema for a richer experience. The snippet proposals are shown as additional completion proposals and use the snippet syntax to specify placeholders. See the [JSON documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-settings) for more information.
