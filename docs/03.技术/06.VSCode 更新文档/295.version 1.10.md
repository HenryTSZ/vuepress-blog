### [Run in terminal commands](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_10#_run-in-terminal-commands)

In previous releases, there was the single command `workbench.action.terminal.runSelectedText` which sent text to the terminal. This would send either the selection if there was one, or the entire file if not. This caused some issues as users would accidentally run entire files when they were expecting to run the current *line* if there was no selection. Running a file would also not work in some shells as the shell would interpret the text in chunks, not as a whole. To improve these scenarios, there are now two commands with distinct behaviors:

- `workbench.action.terminal.runSelectedText`: Sends the selection if there is one to the terminal, otherwise sends the current line.
- `workbench.action.terminal.runActiveFile`: Sends the *file path* of the active file to the terminal (in most shells this will execute the file).

### [Auto JSDoc comments](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_10#_auto-jsdoc-comments)

VS Code will now provide a [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) comment template for JavaScript and TypeScript functions when you type `/**`:

### [HTML](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_10#_html)

Document symbols are now available also for HTML, allowing you to quickly navigate to DOM nodes by id and class name.

Press ⇧⌘O to bring up the symbol in file.
