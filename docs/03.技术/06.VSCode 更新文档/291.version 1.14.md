### [Switch window improvements](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_14#_switch-window-improvements)

In a previous release, we added a quick picker for switching between the opened windows (via the `workbench.action.switchWindow` command). In this release, we did some tweaks to make the experience better.

You will now see icons for the currently active file or folder in the window, provided that you have enabled one of the File Icon themes.

In addition, a new command `workbench.action.quickSwitchWindow` was added to quickly switch between opened windows. Press and hold the modifier key to cycle through the list of windows and release all keys to open it.

As an example, to use this feature with the `Ctrl+R` keyboard shortcut, configure the following rule in the keybindings editor:

```json
[
  {
    "key": "ctrl+r",
    "command": "workbench.action.quickSwitchWindow"
  },
  {
    "key": "ctrl+r",
    "command": "workbench.action.quickOpenNavigateNext",
    "when": "inWindowsPicker"
  }
]
```

Press `Ctrl+R` and leave the `Ctrl` key pressed. As long as you now press the `R` key, you can navigate through the list of windows. Release all keys to focus it.

### [Manage your .gitignore file](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_14#_manage-your-gitignore-file)

[@BugraC](https://github.com/BugraC) also provided a change so that you can now add files to your `.gitignore` right from the context menu of the Source Control view or via the global Git: Add File to .gitignore command.

### [Emmet abbreviation improvements](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_14#_emmet-abbreviation-improvements)

In the previous release, we introduced a new model for Emmet features which you can enable by setting `emmet.useNewEmmet` to `true`. Below are the improvements to this new model in the current release:

Multi cursor support in Emmet

Try out the multi cursor support for many of the Emmet commands after setting `emmet.useNewEmmet` to `true` and don't forget to log issues if you find anything not working as expected.

Emmet customizations in the new Emmet model

The new Emmet model supports the following Emmet settings:

- `emmet.includeLanguages`

  Add Emmet: Expand Abbreviation and Emmet: Wrap with Abbreviation support to the language of your choice by providing a mapping to an existing Emmet supported language. The new language goes on the left and the Emmet supported language on the right. Use language ids for both sides of the mapping. For example:

  ```json
  "emmet.includeLanguages": {
      "javascript": "javascriptreact",
      "vue-html": "html",
      "plaintext": "jade"
  }
  ```

- `emmet.excludeLanguages`

  If there is any language where you do not want to see Emmet expansions, add it in this setting which takes an array of language ID strings.

- `emmet.syntaxProfiles`

  See [Emmet Customization of output profile](https://docs.emmet.io/customization/syntax-profiles/#create-your-own-profile) to learn how you can customize the output of your HTML abbreviations. For example:

  ```json
  "emmet.syntaxProfiles": {
      "html": {
          "attr_quotes": "single"
      },
      "jsx": {
          "self_closing_tag": true
      }
  }
  ```

- `emmet.variables`

  Customize variables used by Emmet snippets. For example:

  ```json
  "emmet.variables": {
      "lang": "de",
      "charset": "UTF-16"
  }
  ```

- `emmet.showExpandedAbbreviation`

  Controls the Emmet suggestions that show up in the suggestion/completion list.

  - `never` - Never show Emmet abbreviations in the suggestion list for any language.
  - `inMarkupAndStylesheetFilesOnly` - Emmet abbreviations in the suggestion list for languages that are markup and stylesheet based ('html','pug','slim','haml','xml','xsl','css','scss','sass','less','stylus') (default).
  - `always` - Emmet abbreviations in the suggestion list in languages that are markup and stylesheet based as well as `javascriptreact`, `typescriptreact` and any other language that has been mapped in the new setting `emmet.includeLanguages`.

  Note: In the `always` mode, the new Emmet implementation is not context aware. For example, if you are editing a JavaScript React file, you will get Emmet suggestions not only when writing markup but also while writing JavaScript.

Enable language extensions to provide Emmet suggestions

To get around the issue of having Emmet suggestions show up in the non-markup and non-stylesheet sections of your source code, we have pulled out the Emmet completion provider to a module of its own. This enables language extensions to use the npm module [vscode-emmet-helper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-emmet-helper) and provide Emmet suggestions in the right context as they are more aware of the language structure than the Emmet extension.
