## [September 2018 (version 1.28)](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_28)

Welcome to the September 2018 release of Visual Studio Code. During this housekeeping milestone, we addressed several feature requests and community [pull requests](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_28#_thank-you) also resulted in new features. Here are some of the release highlights:

- [Jump to last edit](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_28#_navigate-to-last-edit-location) - New command to go to the location of your last edit.
- [Save without formatting](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_28#_save-without-formatters) - Save a file without changing the existing formatting.
- [Git improvements](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_28#_git-integration) - Better delete conflict handling, new rebase on sync option.

### [Project level snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_28#_project-level-snippets)

Snippets can now be scoped to a project and shared with your team. Simply use the Preferences: Configure User Snippets command or create `*.code-snippets` file in the `.vscode` folder. Project snippets work just like other snippets, they show up in IntelliSense and in the Insert Snippet action where they now have their own category.

![Project Level Snippet](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_28/project-snippet.jpg)

Snippets also now support multiple prefixes. If you cannot decide if your copyright header snippet should be prefixed as `header`, `stub`, or `copyright`, you can have them all. Simply use a string array as the `prefix` property.

```json
{
  "prefix": ["header", "stub", "copyright"],
  "body": "Copyright. Foo Corp 2028",
  "description": "Adds copyright...",
  "scope": "javascript,typescript"
}
```

### [Record and search keyboard shortcuts](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_28#_record-and-search-keyboard-shortcuts)

In the Keyboard Shortcuts editor (⌘K ⌘S), you can now search for keybindings just by typing keystrokes instead of typing out the key name (example 'shift'). Turn on the Recording Keys mode and type the keystrokes you want to search for.

![Record Keys](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_28/record-keybindings.gif)

You can also enter into the Recording Keys mode using ⌥⌘K. Press the `Esc` key to exit from Recording Keys mode.

### [Give focus to a custom view](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_28#_give-focus-to-a-custom-view)

You can now use a command to give focus to a custom view. There is a separate command provided for each custom view.

![Custom view focus commands](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_28/custom-view-focus-commands.png)

### [Tab completion](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_28#_tab-completion)

Editor Tab completion can now complete all kind of suggestions. After setting `"editor.tabCompletion": "on"`, pressing Tab will complete any prefix, not just snippets. Also, pressing Tab will insert the next suggestion and ⇧Tab will insert the previous suggestion.

![Tab completion](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_28/tabcompletion.gif)

### [Navigate to last edit location](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_28#_navigate-to-last-edit-location)

A new command Go to Last Edit Location (`workbench.action.navigateToLastEditLocation`) was added to quickly navigate to the last location in a file that was edited. The default keybinding is `⌘K ⌘Q`.

### [Save without formatters](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_28#_save-without-formatters)

The new command Save without Formatting (`workbench.action.files.saveWithoutFormatting`) can be used to save a file without triggering any of the save participants (for example, formatters, remove trailing whitespace, final newline). The default keybinding is `⌘K S`. This is useful when editing files outside your normal projects, which may have different formatting conventions.

### [IntelliSense locality bonus](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_28#_intellisense-locality-bonus)

Suggestions can now be sorted based on their distance to the cursor. Set `"editor.suggest.localityBonus": true` and you'll see, for example, function parameters showing up at the top of the IntelliSense list.

![Locality bonus](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_28/locality-bonus.png)

### [Emmet](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_28#_emmet)

We have made a few improvements to the Emmet features this iteration:

- If you have enabled Emmet in JavaScript files, then you can now have Emmet abbreviation expansion inside the `<script>` tags in an HTML file.
- The Emmet: Wrap with Abbreviation feature is no longer restricted to files with the `.html` extension.
- The Emmet: Balance (inward) feature now works on current node even if there is no selection.
- The [bug](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/56082) of wrongfully considering CSS selectors with a `#` in SCSS files as valid abbreviations is now fixed.

### [Disable progress reporting](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_28#_disable-progress-reporting)

With the `git.showProgress` setting, you can now disable showing progress during Git operations.

### [Push --force](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_28#_push-force)

There are times in your development day-to-day in which you just feel like taking a risk. Running `git push --force` is a great example! VS Code now lets you forcefully push commits to a remote without the need to go into a terminal. Use the `git.allowForcePush`, `git.useForcePushWithLease` and `git.confirmForcePush` settings to control this behavior. See issue [53286](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/53286) for more details.

### [Rename import path](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_28#_rename-import-path)

Realize that an imported file could use a better name? Now can you rename the referenced file just by renaming the import:

![Renaming an JavaScript import to rename a file](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_28/ts-rename-import.gif)

### [Convert to async function](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_28#_convert-to-async-function)

The new Convert to async function suggestion for JavaScript and TypeScript rewrites functions that use `.then` Promise chaining to use `async` and `await`:

![Converting a promise chain to an async function](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_28/ts-convert-to-async.gif)

> Note that this feature requires that the setting `javascript.validate.enable` is set to true.

### [Semicolon as a commit character for JS/TS](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_28#_semicolon-as-a-commit-character-for-jsts)

Semicolon is now a commit character for JavaScript and TypeScript suggestions. This means that you can accept that current suggestion just by typing `;`. Existing commit characters also include `.` and `(`.

You can disable commit characters by setting `"editor.acceptSuggestionOnCommitCharacter": false`.

### [HTML and CSS path completion excludes dot files](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_28#_html-and-css-path-completion-excludes-dot-files)

Files that start with `.` are now excluded from path completion results.

### [Better Markdown folding](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_28#_better-markdown-folding)

Multiline lists, fenced code blocks, and raw HTML are now foldable in Markdown files:

![Folding Markdown code blocks and lists](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_28/markdown-folding.gif)

### [Markdown preview now opens links to local files in the preview](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_28#_markdown-preview-now-opens-links-to-local-files-in-the-preview)

In the Markdown preview, clicking on a link to a local file will now open that file's preview:

![Local file link open in preview](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_28/markdown-preview-link.gif)

This makes browsing documentation easier. Use the `markdown.preview.openMarkdownLinks` setting to configure how links are handled. Valid settings values are:

- `inEditor` - Open local Markdown links in an editor.
- `inPreview` - Open local Markdown links in the current preview. This is new default behavior.

### [Better configuration when clauses](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_28#_better-configuration-when-clauses)

When authoring keybindings or menu visibility, [when clauses](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/when-clause-contexts) are used. In a when clause, you can reference a configuration (setting) value by prefixing it with `config.`, for example `config.editor.tabCompletion`. Only boolean configuration properties had been supported but with this release, you can also use string and number values.
