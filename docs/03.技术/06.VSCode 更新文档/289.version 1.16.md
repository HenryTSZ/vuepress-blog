### [Drag and drop from Search results and Problems panel](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_16#_drag-and-drop-from-search-results-and-problems-panel)

You can now drag files from the Search results and Problems panel over the editor area to control where these should open. The File Explorer always supported this and we have now expanded that feature to other regions of the UI.

### [Open a folder via drag and drop](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_16#_open-a-folder-via-drag-and-drop)

VS Code has always supported dragging a folder from outside VS Code into it to open the folder. VS Code stills support this, but the visual feedback is changed a little bit. Previously you could drop the folder anywhere in VS Code to open it. With this release, you need to drop the folder over the editor area to open it. This change is due to both a technical reason (an Electron update) as well as an explicit decision to make the multi-root experience better. If you are using VS Code Insiders with multi-root support, you will be happy to hear that you can now drop a folder into the File Explorer to add it to the workspace.

### [Smooth scrolling](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_16#_smooth-scrolling)

Thanks to the work of [@JD342](https://github.com/JD342) in [PR #25286](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/25286), the editor now has a new option, `editor.smoothScrolling`, that will make the editor scroll with an animation. Once enabled, scrolling between different locations when using `Page Up` or `Page Down`, when cycling through find matches, when jumping to a definition in the same file, and when using the mouse wheel will be animated.

> Note: Our platform currently does not support differentiating between scrolling initiated by a touchpad or a physical mouse wheel, and we currently use a heuristic to determine if smooth scrolling should be applied.

### [Emmet suggestions as snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_16#_emmet-suggestions-as-snippets)

Emmet in suggestions/auto-completion list is most helpful when it is in the top few choices. There are two scenarios where Emmet suggestions can get pushed down the list:

- You have set `editor.snippetSuggestions` to `top` and so default/user/extension snippets are on top of your suggestion list.
- When working on stylesheets, Emmet suggestions get sorted alphabetically among other CSS suggestions.

To ensure Emmet suggestions stay on top of the suggestion list, set the new `emmet.showSuggestionsAsSnippets` to `true` and `editor.snippetSuggestions` to `top`.

### [Emmet preferences](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_16#_emmet-preferences)

The setting `emmet.preferences` as documented in [Emmet Preferences](https://docs.emmet.io/customization/preferences/) was discontinued in the last release as the new modular approach in [Emmet 2.0](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/08/07/emmet-2.0) did not support them.

We are bringing back support for a few of these preferences via the setting `emmet.preferences`:

- `css.propertyEnd`
- `css.valueSeparator`
- `sass.propertyEnd`
- `sass.valueSeparator`
- `stylus.propertyEnd`
- `stylus.valueSeparator`
- `css.unitAliases`
- `css.intUnit`
- `css.floatUnit`

If you want support for any of the other preferences, please log a [feature request](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/new) for the same.

### [Snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_16#_snippets)

There is a new snippet variable: `$TM_FILENAME_BASE`. It resolves to the filename without extension, so from `/my/super/file.ts` it resolves to `file`.

### [HTML close tags](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_16#_html-close-tags)

Tag elements are now automatically closed when `>` of the opening tag is typed:

![Auto close on ](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_16/auto-close1.gif)

The matching closing tag is inserted when `/` of the closing tag is entered:

![Auto close on ](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_16/auto-close2.gif)

The new behavior is enabled by default and can be turned off with the setting `html.autoClosingTags`

Thanks to [Jun Han](https://github.com/formulahendry) for leading the way with his [Auto Close Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-close-tag). Note that the Auto Close Tag extension has more features, in particular, it can be enabled for languages other than HTML as well.

### [JavaScript and TypeScript refactorings](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_16#_javascript-and-typescript-refactorings)

The new Extract method and Extract function code actions allow you to quickly refactor complex JavaScript or TypeScript code into new methods or functions:

![](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_16/ts-extract.gif)

Simply select some code, then click on the lightbulb in the gutter or press (⌘.) to see available refactorings. Source code fragments can be extracted into a new method, or into a new function at various different scopes.

### [JSDoc type assertions](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_16#_jsdoc-type-assertions)

You can now use write JSDoc type assertions in JavaScript files:

```js
// @ts-check

const img = /** @type {HTMLImageElement} */ (document.getElementById('#cat'))
img.src = './cat.gif'
```

This is particularly useful when using `@ts-check` to enable [type checking in your JavaScript code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/javascript#_type-checking).

### [Markdown preview refresh command](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_16#_markdown-preview-refresh-command)

The new Markdown: Refresh Preview command allows you to manually refresh the contents of a Markdown preview.

![](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_16/markdown-refresh.png)

This can be used to reload images that have been modified on the file system.
